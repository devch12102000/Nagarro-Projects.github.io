                Pikachu is widely considered to be the most popular and well-known Pokémon species, largely due to its
                appearance in the Pokémon anime television series as the companion of protagonist Ash Ketchum. In most
                vocalized appearances Pikachu is voiced by Ikue Ōtani, though it has been portrayed by other actors, notably
                Ryan Reynolds in the live-action animated film Pokémon Detective Pikachu. Pikachu has been well received by
                critics, with particular praise given for its cuteness, and has come to be regarded as an icon of Japanese
                pop culture.</dd>
